# Data analysis of perception of materials project
Python scripts used for the analysis of the data collected during my master's thesis experiment and the follow-up. 

This repository contains the analysis code and sound stimulus materials used in my study: Perception of materials in VR based on their audiovisual properties.

The published abstract can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.24.10.1208

The thesis (covering exp 1) can be found here: https://ocul-yor.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_YOR/1jocqcq/alma991037283476005164

The entire study including experiment 1 and 2 is in the process of being published.

The anonymized user data collected will be uploaded to the university dataverse, the link will be added here once that is completed. 

This repository includes: the google colab files used to analyze the data (saved as python notebooks), the auditory stimulus used and its spectrograms.

No human-subject or personally identifiable data is included. The audio files are isolated material impact recordings used as controlled experimental stimuli. They are not intended as standalone listening experiences.
